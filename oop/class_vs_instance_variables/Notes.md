# Class vs instance variables

- Class variables can hold a default value and if so, that value will be present and have the same value for each class instance.
- After being declared, a class variable value can be modified as such:

```
ClassName.classVariable = newValue
```

- Instance variables' values are object-specific and are specified in the constructor.
